more command in Linux with Examples

more command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying one screen at a time in case the file is large (For example log files). The more command also allows the user do scroll up and down through the page. The syntax along with options and command is as follows. Another application of more is to use it with some other command after a pipe. When output is large, we can use more command to see output one by one.

Syntax:

    more [-options] [-num] [+/pattern] [+linenum] [file_name]

    [-options]: any option that you want to use in order to change the way the file is displayed.
    Choose any one from the following-:
    (-d, -l, -f, -p, -c, -s, -u)
    [-num]: type the number of lines that you want to display per screen.
    [+/pattern]: replace pattern with any string that you want to find in the text file.
    [+linenum]: use the line number from where you want to start displaying the text content.
    [file_name]: name of the file containing the text that you want to display on the screen.

while viewing the text file use these controls :


    Enter key: to scroll down line by line.
    Space bar: To go to the next page.
    b key: To go to back one page.

options used with more command
-d :use this command in order to help the user to navigate. It displays “[Press space to continue, ‘q’ to quit.]” and displays “[Press ‘h’ for instructions.]” when wrong key is pressed.
Example:

Input : 
more -d sample.txt
Output :

-f :this command does not wrap the long lines and displays them as such.
Example:

Input : 
more -f sample.txt
Output :

-p :this command clears the screen and then displays the text.
Example:

Input : 
more -p sample.txt
Output :

-c :this command is used to display the pages on the same area by overlapping the previous displayed text.
Example:

Input : 
more -c sample.txt
Output :

-s :this command squeezes multiple blank lines into one single blank line.
Example:

Input : 
more -s sample.txt
Output :

-u :this command omits the underlines.
Example:

Input : 
more -u sample.txt

+/pattern :this command is used to search the the string inside your text document.You can view all the instances by navigating through the result.
Example:

Input : 
more +/reset sample.txt
Output :

+num :this command displays the text after the specified number of lines of the document.
Example:

Input : 
more +30 sample.txt
Output :

Using more to read long outputs
We use more command after a pipe to see long outputs. For example, seeing log files, etc.

cat a.txt | more

A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. 



n addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food. 



The essential parts of a flower can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of petals and associated structures in the perianth, and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower consists of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk. Each of these kinds of parts is arranged in a whorl on the receptacle. The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are as follows:
